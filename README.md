# KrishiVeer (Crop-Recomendation System)

Crop recommendation, also known as crop planning or crop selection, involves suggesting the most suitable crops for cultivation in a specific area based on various factors such as soil type, climate conditions, water availability, and market demand. Crop recommendation systems utilize data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and domain knowledge to provide personalized recommendations to farmers, agronomists, and agricultural stakeholders.Crop recommendation systems are valuable tools in agriculture for several reasons:

--> Increased Productivity: By recommending the most suitable crops for a particular location based on  factors like soil type, climate conditions, and water availability, these systems help farmers maximize their yield potential.
--> Optimized Resource Allocation: Crop recommendation systems enable farmers to make informed decisions about resource allocation, such as selecting the appropriate type and amount of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation methods.
--> Risk Mitigation: Agriculture is inherently vulnerable to various risks, including weather fluctuations, pests, and diseases.
--> Sustainable Agriculture: By promoting the cultivation of crops that are well-adapted to local conditions, crop recommendation systems contribute to sustainable agriculture practices.

This Application recommends the best crop to plant based on Soil composition by usng DecisionTree model and gives out the Acuracy score and other visualizations, Ph level, rainfall, humidity, and temperature. It was created based on a Kaggle dataset.
